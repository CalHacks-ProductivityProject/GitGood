GitGood - friendly competition through GitHub
=======
As developers we all use Github. As developers, we all love to ask the question "Who does the most work? Who is the best programmer?" With GitGood, we have our answer. GitGood is an iPhone application that allows developers using GitHub to challenge their friends in an attempt to find out who does the most work. 

How it works:

GitHub has some pretty cool analytical tools. On your GitHub account, you can track additions, deletions, commits, number of repositories... the amount of personalized developer information is endless. 
Using the GitHub API, GitGood accesses this developer information, giving you the opportunity to compare yourself to your friends. 

To challenge your friends all you have to do is create a challenge, and GitGood does the rest.

Signing in:
Upon first launch, you will be prompted to enter a valid GitHub username and password. With authentication, GitGood can access your developer analytics using the GitHub API. 

Creating a challenge:
After signing in, create a challenge! Within the application, create a new challenge and enter the GitHub usernames of the friends/strangers you would like to challenge.

Each challenge has:

--Users! - Challenge friends or strangers, it is up to you.

--Number of weeks - How long do you want the challenge to last?

--Bet Amount in $USD - How much do you want to bet? Enter any value in USD and we can keep it safe until the challenge is over. Using the PayPal API, your payments are secure and effortless! 


So who is the winner?

As of now, GitGood uses the total amount of Additions and Deletions that are associated with the users repositories. So get coding!


How am I paid?

After your challenge is over, your paypal account will either be deducted the bet amount, or your winnings will be deposited. Easy


How will I know if I have been challenged?

Push notifications are used to give you updates on your challenges.
